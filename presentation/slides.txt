Presentation draft:

* Functional roots of Javascript
  - "Lisp in C clothing", influenced by Scheme (dialect of Lisp)
  - Limitations: no tail call optimization

* Typescript re-invigorates the functional roots of JavaScript
  - Functional programming in 1990s: functions are "first-class citizens"
  - Functional programming in 2020s: typing theory advances, OOP and FP can be combined
  - Sorry Dart, adding types should not mean giving up the functional nature of JavaScript, wrong direction chosen?

* Typeclasses: why they are needed, and how to define one in Typescript
  - Monoid example
  - Why all this theory and abstractions: example of combineAll

* Not quite a functional language however
  - Again no tail call optimization
  - Coming more from the practical perspective: "how to add typings to JavaScript in a backward-compatible manner"
  - However, still includes many useful features and can be used in a functional manner
  More boiler-plate code due to:
    - Withot "return" statement function returns "undefined" :(
    - Lots of braces and syntactic noise (C legacy - imperative language)
    - Missing higher kinded types: i.e. "Promise" is not considered to be a separate type ("type constructor") in addition to "Promise<T>":
    - No way to define useful automatic conversions between types and related syntactic sugar (ala Haskell or Scala 3): more boiler-plate
    - Some advanced type constructs, such as union types, but no type lambdas, for example
    - No pattern matching => type tag field in the Option implementation

* The most useful typeclass: Monad
  - More extended example of a Monad for Option and how HKT might be defined in Typescript
  - How to define a HKT and a typeclass requiring HKT definition for an existing type: example of Promise
  - More advanced monad and the example of its usage: Reader

* fp-ts as a library defining useful types and typeclasses and promoting FP in Typescript

* Practical monads: you might be already using them and no typeclasses/deeper knowledge of the theory might be needed
  - Generator monad and Maybe monad from gen.js

* Q & A
